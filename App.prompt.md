Create a real-time multiplayer programming game inspired by Reeborg's World where players compete by writing code to control characters. The game should:

GAME MECHANICS

- Support multiple programming languages (Python, Java, C++, C)
- Allow concurrent gameplay for multiple players in isolated instances
- Implement a secure code execution environment with timeouts and memory limits
- Track player positions, actions, and scores in real-time
- Include a time limit per challenge/round

SCORING SYSTEM

- Award points based on:
  - Code efficiency (fewer lines/operations)
  - Execution time
  - Memory usage
  - Successful completion of objectives
  - Bonus points for optimal solutions
- Deduct points for:
  - Failed execution attempts
  - Code that exceeds time/memory limits
  - Using restricted functions/libraries

CORE FEATURES

1. Code Execution Engine

- Sandboxed environment for each language
- Standard input/output handling
- Error detection and reporting
- Performance metrics collection

2. Multiplayer Components

- Player authentication and session management
- Real-time game state synchronization
- Match-making system
- Inter-player communication protocol

3. Leaderboard System

- Real-time score updates
- Global and per-match rankings
- Historical performance tracking
- Achievement system

4. Challenge Framework

- Multiple difficulty levels
- Randomized obstacles/objectives
- Progressive complexity
- Time-based rounds

Please provide specific technical requirements and constraints for implementation.
